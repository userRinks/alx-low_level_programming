# 0x10: Variadic Functions

## Overview

The "0x10: Variadic Functions" project introduces the concept of variadic functions in the C programming language. Variadic functions allow us to define functions that can accept a variable number of arguments. This flexibility is particularly useful when dealing with functions that require a variable number of inputs or outputs. This project explores the usage and implementation of variadic functions, showcasing their versatility in handling different types and quantities of arguments.

## Description

The project contains several files that demonstrate the use and implementation of variadic functions in C programming. Each file focuses on a specific aspect of variadic functions and highlights their practical applications.

The files included in this project are:

| File Name              | Description                                                       |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `0-sum_them_all.c`     | Implements the `sum_them_all` function, which calculates the sum of a variable number of integers. |
| `1-print_numbers.c`    | Defines the `print_numbers` function, which prints a variable number of integers. |
| `2-print_strings.c`    | Implements the `print_strings` function, which prints a variable number of strings. |
| `3-print_all.c`        | Contains the `print_all` function, which prints a variable number of arguments of different types based on a specified format. |
| `variadic_functions.h` | Header file that includes function prototypes for the project's functions. |

Each file presents a practical example of utilizing variadic functions in different scenarios. By studying and experimenting with these files, you will gain a solid understanding of variadic functions and their applications in handling variable arguments.

## Usage

To explore and utilize the variadic functions demonstrated in this project, follow these steps:
