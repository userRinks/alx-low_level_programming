# Project Title

Bit Manipulation.

## Description

This subdirectory contains C scripts that manipulates bits in four main number formats:
    * Binary
    * Hexadecimal
    * Decimal
    * Octal

Combined with logic statements such as `AND (&)`, `OR(|)`, `NOT(~)`, `XOR(^)`among others, bits can be computed and used to do all kinds of functions.

C also supports bit-shifting, which allows the value of bits to be manipulated easily and making life easier.
