# More Singly Linked Lists

Linked lists for data structures containing integers

## Description

Project [`0x12-singly_linked_lists`](https://github.com/userRinks/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x12-singly_linked_lists) introduced linked lists and I wrote a few C scripts to manipulate elements and nodes of lists, including a few lines of assembly code.

This is a continuation of linked lists in which we do more element/node manipulation for a data structure `listint_t` contained in the header file `lists.h`

Each C instruction script has a filename which can give you an idea of what the function will do. For instance, `0-print_list.c` will count and, as the name suggests, print all elements of the data structure `listint_t`. The description of each C script can be seen when you open the files.
