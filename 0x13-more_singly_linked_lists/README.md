# More Singly Linked Lists

Linked lists for data structures containing integers

## Description

Project `0x12-singly_linked_lists`(https://github.com/userRinks/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x12-singly_linked_lists) introduced linked lists and I wrote a few C scripts to manipulate elements and nodes of lists, including some assembly code.

This is a continuation of linked lists in which we do more element/node manipulation for a data structure listint_s contained in the header file `lists.h`
